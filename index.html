<p style="color:red;">I will be applying to PhD programs Fall of 2024</p>


<br>I am an undergrad at <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a> with a broad interest in the
areas of systems and networking. My aim is to utilize expertise and apply techniques from multiple areas, including
Programming Languages, Theory, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, and Networking
to find new insights. My philosophy is that focusing on deeply understanding a problem naturally leads to finding simple
and effective solutions.<br><br>


<h2>Research Interests</h2>

My research focuses on programmable networks and SDN, specifically applied to runtime verification
techniques for networks. This approach verifies network behavior against a specification as packets flow
through the network in realtime. I am fortunate to collaborate with <a href="http://yuba.stanford.edu/~nickm/">Nick
    McKeown's</a>
group at Stanford on this project.
<br><br>


I am also interested in terabit data center networking and host congestion. My work in this area focuses on building an
understanding of the host networking stack overheads and datapaths. I am currently leading a project on a receiver
driven transport protocol for effectively dealing with in-network and host interconnect congestion. <br> I am very
thankful to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/">Nate Foster</a> and <a
    href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ragarwal/">Rachit Agarwal</a>.<br><br>

<h2>Teaching</h2>


I also have a deep passion for teaching, which extends to all age groups. I have had the opportunity to work with young
kids, helping them with math
enrichment and learning to code.
At Cornell, I have been a TA for the Operating Systems course since the beginning of my sophomore year.
Alongside my teaching responsibilities, I contribute to the development of new coursework and assignments, enriching the
learning experience for students interested in concurrent programming. <br>

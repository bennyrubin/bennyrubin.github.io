<p style="color:red;">I will be applying to PhD programs Fall of 2024</p>


<br>I am an undergrad at <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>, My interests lie broadly in the
areas of systems and networking. My aim is to utilize expertise and apply techniques from multiple areas, including
Programming Languages, Theory, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, and Networking
to find new insights. My philosophy is that if you can truly understand a problem, the solution is obvious and will
naturally appear.<br><br>

My research focuses on programmable networks and SDN, specifically applied to runtime verification
techniques for networks. <br>

I am also interested in terabit data center networking and host congestion. My work in this area focuses on building an
understanding of the host networking stack overheads and datapaths. I am currently leading a project on a receiver
driven transport protocol for effectively dealing with in-network and host interconnect congestion <br> I am very
fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/">Nate Foster</a> and <a
    href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ragarwal/">Rachit Agarwal</a>.<br><br>

I also have a deep passion for teaching, across all age groups. I have worked with young kids, helping them with math
enrichment and learning to code.
At Cornell, I have been a TA for the Operating Systems course since the beginning of my sophomore year. Along with my
teaching responsibilities,
I also help create new coursework and assignments for students to learn about concurrent programming.

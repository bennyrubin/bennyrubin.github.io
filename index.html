title: Overview
subtitle: PhD student at MIT CSAIL
---
<br>
I am an incoming PhD student in MIT CSAIL, funded by an MIT Jacobs Presidential Fellowship and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Before that I was an undergrad at <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>. I did research in the
broad areas of systems and networking.<br><br>

My research focuses on high speed data center networking and host congestion. Specifically, I have been looking at inefficiencies 
within IO memory protection mechanisms. My work in this area has led to an in depth understanding of the overheads of enabling IO
memory protection and a simple solution that near-completely eliminates these overheads. 

<br><br>
In the past, I have worked on programmable networks and SDN, specifically applied to runtime verification
techniques for networks. This approach verifies network behavior against a specification as packets flow
through the network in realtime. 

<br><br> I am very
thankful to have been advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/">Nate Foster</a> and <a
    href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ragarwal/">Rachit Agarwal</a>.<br><br>

<h2>Teaching</h2>

I also have a deep passion for teaching, which extends to all age groups. I have had the opportunity to work with young
kids, helping them with math enrichment and learning to code.
At Cornell, I have been a TA for the Operating Systems course since the beginning of my sophomore year.
Alongside my teaching responsibilities, I contribute to the development of new coursework and assignments, enriching the
learning experience for students interested in systems. <br>
